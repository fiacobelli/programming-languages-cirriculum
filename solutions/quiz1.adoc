. Write an algorithm in pseudocode describing how to make change assuming you have 1's, 5's, 10's and 20's. Use the following starter code:
====
[source]
----
void makeChange(int amount)
{
  int ones = 0;
  int fives = 0;
  int tens = 0;
  int twenties = 0;

  twenties = amount / 20
  amount = amount % 20
  tens = amount / 10
  amount = amount % 10
  fives = amount / 5
  ones = amount % 5
}

. Write an algorithm in pseudocode that generates the nth number in a Fibonacci sequence.
====
[source]
----
int fib(int n)
{
  if(n < 3)
    return 1
  else
    int prev = 1
    int current = 1
    for int i from 3 to n
      int temp = current
      current = current + prev
      prev = temp
    return current
}
