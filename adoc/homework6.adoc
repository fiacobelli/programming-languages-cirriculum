= Homework 5

Create an HTML front end for each of your applications you submitted for link:homework5.html[Homework 5].

Each HTML front end should provide a form to interact with your RESTful service.

One front end should use a POST/REDIRECT approach that displays a result page.

The other front end should use a javascript-based reactive page for interacting with the application and displaying the results.
