= Homework 4

Create an application that handles the four basic math operations (`+`,`-`,`*`,`/`) on two positive integers.
The program must:
. Read the contents of a file (e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhoads-zach/programming-languages-cirriculum/master/examples/homework4-ops.txt).
. Process each line as an individual operation (e.g. `1 + 2`).
. Print the result the the console in the format `OPERATION = ANSWER` (e.g. `1 + 2 = 3`).

You must implement this application twice:
* With a Statically typed language
* With a Dynamically typed language

Submit each application's source file with a README explaining how to run the application with `homework4-ops.txt`.
