== Course Goals
* Learn the base concepts in core to programming language design.
* Understand how to implement or use those base concepts in various languages.
* Using concepts in programming languages to solve practical problems.

== Outcomes
* Have working knowledge of programming language topics.
* Understand how different choices in programming language design impact problem solving in that language.
* Gain exposure to modern software development problems.
* Ability to make informed decisions when choosing a language to solve a problem.
