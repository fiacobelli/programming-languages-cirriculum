= Part2 - Basics in Action

== Declarative/imperative Languages

=== Assignments and flow Control
* variable definition and evaluation
* looping
* iteration
* if/then/case
* exceptions

=== Typing
* primitives and first-class citizens
** how are strings handled?
** mutability vs. immutability
* operators
* enums
* structs
* classes/objects
** pointers
** compare to primitives
* evaluating and comparing
** precision
** integer divide
** `=` vs. `==`
* static and dynamic
* strong and weak

=== Functions
* definition
* return values
** returning multiple values
* call by value v.s. call by reference
* scoping with functions


=== interpreted and compiled
* pros and cons of each
* error handling in each
* Troubleshooting and coding
** When will syntax issues show up?
** When can you catch evaluation issues?
** How do you debug programs?
** compile time issues vs. runtime issues


== Functional Languages

=== Lambdas
* Lambda calculus
* Lambda functions
** examples in different languages

=== Blocks
* Difference between lambdas and blocks
** Examples in different languages

=== passing functions
* Passing functions into functions
** by Names
** as blocks
** as callbacks

=== Pros and cons
* where do functional languages shine?
* where do that struggle?
* functional language concepts in declarative languages

== Object Oriented Languages
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Generics
* The diamond problem
* Comparators
