= Algorithms

* Method for solving a problem
* Often implemented by a program, but does not have to be
* An algorithm can be defined at a high-level, absent of a programming language
** This is sometimes called pseudocode

=== Factorial
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial

The factorial of `n` is the product of all positive integers from 1 to `n`. `!` is used to denote factorial.

.Example

----
0! = 1
1! = 1
2! = 2*1 = 2
3! = 3*2*1 = 6
4! = 4*3*2*1= 24
5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120
...
n! = n(n-1)(n-2)....(3)(2)(1)

.Example Algorithm in Psudedocode

----
integer factorial(n)
{
  if n is less than 1
    return 1
  else
    int factOfN = 1

    for each int i from n to 1
      factOfN = factOfN * i

    return factOfN
}
