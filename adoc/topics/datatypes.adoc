= Datatypes
Source: Chapter 6 ^link:https://github.com/rhoads-zach/programming-languages-cirriculum/blob/master/adoc/topics/sources.adoc[4]^

== Definition
* Collection of values and operations you can perform on those values
* Language provides a set of Datatypes
* Some languages allow user-defined types
* Defined using constructors
* Has a descriptor, which is a collection of attributes of the variable.

== Why do we care about types?
* How you create and manipulate data.
* Provides error detection
* Provides modularization

== Primitives
* any type not defined using other types

=== Numeric Types - Integer
* `0`, `123`, `-999999`
* Signed or Unsigned
* byte, short, int, long
* Max value

=== Numeric Types - Floating Point
* `0.0`, `123.45`, `-999999.999999999`
* Real numbers
* float, double
* max value
* precision defines the accuracy of the floating point
* range is the range of fractions and exponents it can represent

=== Boolean
* `true` or `false`
* sometimes represented by an integer
** `0` is `false`, everything else is `true`

=== Character
* Stores numeric encodings
* `c`, `1`, `*`

== Character Strings
* sequence of characters
* primitive or array of characters?
* static or dynamic length
* `Sarah`, `Washington D.C.`, `What the %@#$ is a String?`

=== Character Strings Operations
* assignment
* catenation
* substring reference
* comparison
* pattern matching
* manipulation

=== Character String Length
* static length strings have their length set when they are created
* limited dynamic length strings can vary in length to a maximum
* dynamic length strings can vary in length with no maximum

=== Character String Implementation
* array of characters vs. primitive
* mutability
* copy
* manipulation

== User-defined Ordinal Types
* Ordinal type is one where range of values can be easily represented by ordinal types
** integer, char, boolean

=== Enumeration Types
* all possible values are enumerated

----
enum months {JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC};

months myBirthMonth = months.JUL;

//cannot do
months invalidMonth = months.ABC;
----


== Array

** array implementations
** array operationns
* associative arrays
** key-value stores
* records
* tuples
* list
* union
* pointers


* Type systems
** type checking
** weak type
** strong types
** type equivalence
** Static vs. dynamic typing
* Type inference
* Objects and classes
