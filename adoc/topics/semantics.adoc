= Semantics
Source: Chapter 3.5 ^link:https://github.com/rhoads-zach/programming-languages-cirriculum/blob/master/adoc/topics/sources.adoc[4]^


== Dynamic Semantics
* describes relationship between a program and its model of computation
* what does it all mean?
** expressions
** Statements
** programming units

== Why does it matter?
* Users of the language need to understand what the language does.
* insert picture of tools

== Why does it matter?
* Implementers of the language (e.g. compiler/interpreter/JVM programmers) need this to understand how their implementation should behave.
* insert picture of screw/nail/joist hangers

== operational semantics
* describes affects on a running machine
* how does the state of a machine change.
** e.g. values in storage
* Think about writing a sample program to figure out what something does.
* natural operational semantics: understanding the final result of the executed program.

== Example
* What is the difference between `++var;` and `var++;` in Java?

[source]
----
int x,y = 0;
System.out.println("x: " + ++x; + "y: " + y++; );
System.out.println("x: " + x; + "y: " + y; );
----

== How does it work?
* Design an lower-level intermediary language to describe your language.
* This can also involve making a reference interpreter or VM.

== Example intermediary language

.Example C Statement
[source,c]
----
for(expr1; expr2; expr3) {...}
----

.Example meaning
[source]
----
      expr1;
loop: if expr2 == 0 goto out
      ...
      expr3;
      goto loop
out:  ...
----

== Considerations for using operational semantics
* Less formal
* Dependent on a lower language, which could lead to issues (e.g. circularities)
* Not a good usecase for complete description due to complexity
** Accounting for full machine execution and storage is difficult

== denotational semantics
* Very rigorous
* based on recursive function theory (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Μ-recursive_function[μ-recursive functions]).
** Can be computed by Turning Machines

== how does it work?
* Each language entity must define:
.. a mathematical object
.. a function that maps the entity to the mathematical object

== Axoimatic semantics
* Based in mathematical logic.
* Most abstract of semantic descriptions
* Focuses on what can be proven about a program
* Program verification
