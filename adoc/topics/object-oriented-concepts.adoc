= Object Oriented Programming Concepts

== Core Concepts
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming
* Based on the concept of objects
** Fields containing data
** Methods that perform operations
* Classes are the definition
* Objects are the instances

== Encapsulation
* Binds together data and methods
* Concept of data hiding
** Data can be hidden from outside objects with scopes

== Inheritance
* Parent child relationship between classes
* Child _inherits_ fields and methods from the parent class
** scope can be use to encapsulate methods and fields from child
* _Shape_ -> _Rectangle_ -> _Square_

== Polymorphism
* Ability to change types of an object using its parent-child relationship
