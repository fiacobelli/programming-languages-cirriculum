= Interpreted and Compiled Languages

== Interpreted Languages

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language

=== Pros and Cons
* Pro: dynamic typing and scoping
* Pro: more platform independence
** Language not complied for a specific platform
* Pro: Option to use a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop[REPL]
* Con: Slower execution
* Con: Lack of static type checking

=== Coding Considerations
* Syntax issues usually do not show up until runtime.
* Syntax can be tested using a REPL.
* Debugger can attach directly to source since code is run directly
* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch[Monkey patching] is an option
* Type issues can be difficult to find until runtime


== Compiled Languages

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language

=== Pros and Cons
* Pro: Faster execution
* Pro: Static type checking
** Catch more issues at compile time
* Con: Can be platform-dependent
* Con: no dynamic typing or scoping

=== Coding Considerations
* Using an IDE with a real-time compiler can give you:
** Active syntax checking
** Active type checking
* Many issues can be caught before runtime
* Debugger must attached to code after compilation
* No access to REPL
* Must re-compile for different platforms
