= Naming, Binding, and Scope
Source: Chapter 5 ^link:https://github.com/rhoads-zach/programming-languages-cirriculum/blob/master/adoc/topics/sources.adoc[4]^

== Name Forms
* Name is a a string of characters used to identify an entity in a program.
* start with a letter
* followed by letters, numbers, and underscores

== Name Forms
* additional conventions
** PHP: variables start with `$`
** Perl: variables start with symbol denoting their type, e.g. `$`, `@`, `%`
** Ruby: variables can start with `@` or `@@` to denote instance or class variables.

== Should there be a max size for a name?
* Different languages take different approaches.
* Fortran95 : max 31
* C99: No limit, but only first 63 chars are used
* Java/C#: No limit

== Should names be case sensitive?
* `FOO` vs. `foo` vs. `Foo`
* What is more readable?
+
[source, java]
----
int foo = 1;
String Foo = "abc";
double FOO = 3.14;

System.out.println("The value is: " + Foo);
----

== Special Words
* Reserved words: words used by the language that cannot be used for names.
** e.g. `int`, `new`, `if`, `for`, `class`
* A keyword is a reserved word in specific contexts.
** Fortran used this.


== Variables
* Abstraction for memory
* Also encapsulates:
** name (see name forms)
** address
** type
** value
** lifetime
** scope

=== Address
* memory address the variable is associated with
* sometimes call _l-value_ since its need when a variable appears on the LHS of an assignment statement.
* A single variable could be associated with multiple addresses, depending on location.
** subprogram instance variable
* A single address can have multiple variables associated with it
** alias

=== Type and Value
* Type determines the range of values you can store and the set of operations allowed.
* Value is the abstract memory cell associated with the variable.
** Abstract memory cells allow you to map different sizes of physical memory with variables of different types.
* Value is sometimes called _r-value_ since its need when a variable appears on the RHS of an assignment statement.

=== Lifetime and Scope
* More on that later...

== Binding
* Association between attribute and entity
* When association takes place is binding time.
** This can happen at various points (e.g. compile time, runtime, design time, etc)
** Example: `*` is bound to multiplication operation at design time, while variable declaration in Java methods happens at runtime.

=== Various Bind Times
* language design time
* language implementation time
* compile time
* load time
* link time
* run time

=== Example Binding
* Given the Java: `count = count + 5;`
** Compile time: type of `count` and meaning of `+`
** compiler design time: set of possible values for `count` and internal representation of `5`
** Execution time: value of `count`.

=== Static and Dynamic binding
* Static binding: if a binding occurs before runtime and remains the same.
* Dynamic binding: if a binding occurs during runtime or changes during runtime.

=== Type Binding
* When declaring a variable, it needs to be bound to a type
* How and when a type is specified is important.
* How a type is specified:
** Static
** Dynamic

=== Static Type Binding
* Static typing occurs during declaration.
* This can be done explicitly or implicitly.
* Explicit declaration happens when you _explicitly_ state they type.
* Implicit declaration happens when the compiler or interpreter can _implicitly_ infer the type based on the declaration.
* Implicit declaration can use type inference.

=== Explicit Declaration
.Example Java
[source]
----
int x = 0;
float y = 0.0;
String s = "zero";
----

=== Explicit Declaration
.Example VB.NET
[source]
----
Dim x As Integer = 0;
Dim y As Decimal = 0.0;
Dim s As String = "zero";
----

=== Explicit Declaration
.Example VB.NET
[source]
----
Dim x% = 0;
Dim y@ = 0.0;
Dim s$ = "zero";
----
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/type-characters

=== Implicit Declaration
.Example C#
[source]
----
var x = 0;
var y = 0.0;
var s = "zero";
----


=== Dynamic Type Binding
* Dynamic typing occurs during variable assignment.
* This happens at execution time.
* A variable type can also change during execution.

=== Dynamic Type Example
.Example JavaScript
[source,JavaScript]
----
var x,y,z;

x = 0;
y = 0.0;
s = "zero";

x = "another zero";
y = z;
----

=== Static vs. Dynamic Typing
* Dynamic typing gives you more flexibility when writing code.
** Any variable can be assigned and reassigned to any type.
** You can also account for handling input that is not typed by the language.

=== Static vs. Dynamic Typing
* Static typing is more reliable, since typing issues can be found at compile time.
* Dynamic typing also has a huge cause of doing type checking during runtime.
** This usually restricts dynamically typed languages to interpreters.


=== Static Variables
* variables that are bound to memory before execution and remain the same throughout execution.


== Scope
* Scope determines the visibility, or what statements can reference, a variable.
* local variables are declared and used in the same program unit or block
* non-local variables are used in different program unit or block than they are declared

=== Scope
* Static scoping allows a variable's scope to be determined statically, before execution.
* Dynamic scoping determines a variables scope during execution.

=== Blocks
* Blocks allow you to have a new scoped section of code during execution.
* Variables are allocated and deallocated during execution.

=== Example Block
.Example Java
[source,java]
----
....
if (x<=10)
{
  int y = 0;
  //do something
  ...
}
----

=== Example Block
.Example Java
[source,JavaScript]
----
$.getJSON("http://example.com/rest/example",
   function(data) {
    var y = 0;
    //do something
   });
----


=== Importance of Order
* Certain languages require all variables be declared at the beginning
* Most require that variables be declared before they are used.


=== Globals
* Allows you to declare variables outside of functions or methods

=== Constants
* Variables that are bound to a value only once.
