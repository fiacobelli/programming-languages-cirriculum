= Homework 3

Create an application that exposes a RESTful service that handles the four basic math operations (`+`,`-`,`*`,`/`) on two numbers.

You must implement this application twice:
* With a Statically typed language
* With a Dynamically typed language

Create each application in a different Github repo and send in the link to each. Each repo should also contain a `README.md` file that explains how to install, run and interact with the application. This file should be formatted using markdown.
