= What is a programming language
A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms. xref:sources[1]

A programming language is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or algorithm.

A complete description of a programming language includes the computational model, the syntax and semantics of programs, and the pragmatic considerations that shape the language. xref:sources[5]
